Module 21 Challenge Repo

The report for this challenge is the "Neural_Network_Report.md" file. The original file, plus all optimization work, and the associated engines are included in this folder.

Please note that after a discussion with my tutor Justin, I opted to run a fourth notebook for optimization testing using the automated process available with the keras tuner. After seeing the results minimally changed, however, I opted to not include it in the summary work I had already completed. I decided to upload the files just to show further work was carried out.
